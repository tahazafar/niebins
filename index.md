## **Vision**
When the bins are not enough to contain the trash of all the residents living in the neighborhood, the streets become messy and the work of the garbage collectors increases. It’s difficult to know the exact location of other bins nearby and many residents are unaware of the recycling bins’ location and their impact on trash production in their neighborhood. 

**NICE bins** is a system which aims to tackle this problem by providing an easy to use and complete service to garbage collectors. Collectors can easily see in the areas they are responsible of if the bins, i.e. for general waste, paper, glass, metal and organic,  are partially full, full or empty and are able to close the ones that reach fullness and choose the bins to open in the most efficient way to allow residents throw their garbage. To increase the capacity of the bins, **NICE bins** compresses the trash present in the bins for organic waste, paper and plastic, allowing more space in them and longer duration of them before collection. In this way collectors can manage the flow of the people to the bins and organize efficiently the resources to empty the full bins, reducing the fuel consumption, the time needed and the amount of work. 

For residents, **NICE bins** provides a platform with the location of the nearest bins and their current state, i.e. available or not available, especially the recycling ones, allowing them to be aware of the waste production in their neighborhood. 

**NICE bins** has the goal to reduce waste and bins, by providing a better overview of the bins’ state to garbage collectors and allowing an improved management of the collection process, as well as keeping the environment neat for the residents in the neighborhood. 

## AmI main steps

**Sensing** : The system senses the level of trash in the bin as well as the situation of the bins nearby.

**Reasoning** :  It calculates the percentage of fullness of the trash bin and evaluates the situation of the bins nearby.

**Acting** :  The system closes the bins and compresses the trash inside them according to the levels of fullness.

**Interacting** : It provides the suggested bins to be opened or closed, the map of the bins in the city and suggestions of the nearest available bins.	

## AmI features 
**Sensitive** : The system senses the level of trash in the bin.

**Responsive** : The system understands when is a good level to compress the waste and also given users’ requests, responds to them with the requested information.

**Adaptive** :  If the garbage bins’ positions are changed, they keep their ability to communicate with other bins.

**Transparent** : Residents don’t need to set up anything when they are throwing their waste and also the system is hidden to them.

**Ubiquitous** : The system can be use in wider areas and their situation is available to be consulted by every user.

**Intelligent** : /

### Open issues

* Main problems: **Communication** between bins and **compression** part: how will it work? compression isn’t trivial.


* It can be **expensive**:  **Scalability** is an issue. It's not easy to adapt this system to the whole city.   
* more knowledge about the economical  technology to deal with the compression of garbage and sense of amount and classification of garbage.
* Maybe getting to know better the **company responsible for managing waste** (AMIAT)  will allow us to provide a specific and customized service addressing actual needs in the garbage collection process.
* Maybe ask some physical information about the compression topic to a **mechanical researcher** and also about some risks in compressing some special materials like organic waste...
* To have a demonstration, we will need to have a real bin, the big one, that **cannot fit the LADISPE’s tables’ size**.
