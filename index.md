## **Vision**

Waste production is constantly increasing in urban areas, leading to waste abandon and untidy neighborhoods. The classification of waste is a priority to create a healthier environment and it helps to reuse and recycle what otherwise remains just waste.

**NICE bins** tackles these issues by making the habit of waste classification easier and fun for residents and by allowing faster notification of waste abandon for trash collectors. Residents receive points according to how often they use classified bins and have access to a crowdsourcing database which shows them the right bin for the items they don’t know how to classify. The more use residents make of classified bins, the more they are recognized as *environmental ambassadors* and rewarded. Residents receive a vocal suggestion of the nearest available bin if the one they want to use is full, saving their time and preventing waste abandon. Trash collectors notify waste abandon in a faster and easier way using **NICE bins** to keep the neighborhood tidy. A map of the bins in the neighborhood is available to show their location and current filling. 

Easier waste classification allows residents to have an active role in reducing waste in their neighborhood and the maintenance of tidy surroundings facilitates the adoption of good habits for the environment.

## AmI main steps

**Sensing** : The system senses the level of trash in the bin as well as the situation of the bins nearby.

**Reasoning** :  It calculates the percentage of fullness of the trash bin and evaluates the situation of the bins nearby.

**Acting** :  The system closes the bins and compresses the trash inside them according to the levels of fullness.

**Interacting** : It provides the suggested bins to be opened or closed, the map of the bins in the city and suggestions of the nearest available bins.	

## AmI features 
**Sensitive** : The system senses the level of trash in the bin.

**Responsive** : The system understands when is a good level to compress the waste and also given users’ requests, responds to them with the requested information.

**Adaptive** :  If the garbage bins’ positions are changed, they keep their ability to communicate with other bins.

**Transparent** : Residents don’t need to set up anything when they are throwing their waste and also the system is hidden to them.

**Ubiquitous** : The system can be use in wider areas and their situation is available to be consulted by every user.

**Intelligent** : /

### Open issues

* Main problems: **Communication** between bins and **compression** part: how will it work? compression isn’t trivial.


* It can be **expensive**:  **Scalability** is an issue. It's not easy to adapt this system to the whole city.   
* more knowledge about the economical  technology to deal with the compression of garbage and sense of amount and classification of garbage.
* Maybe getting to know better the **company responsible for managing waste** (AMIAT)  will allow us to provide a specific and customized service addressing actual needs in the garbage collection process.
* Maybe ask some physical information about the compression topic to a **mechanical researcher** and also about some risks in compressing some special materials like organic waste...
* To have a demonstration, we will need to have a real bin, the big one, that **cannot fit the LADISPE’s tables’ size**.
